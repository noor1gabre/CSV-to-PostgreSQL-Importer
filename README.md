# CSV to PostgreSQL Importer
This Python script allows you to efficiently import data from a CSV file into a PostgreSQL database table using psycopg2.

# Purpose
The purpose of this script is to facilitate the seamless transfer of data from a CSV file to a PostgreSQL database table. It handles the creation of the table schema based on the CSV file columns and efficiently imports data in chunks, using psycopg2 for database interaction.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
psycopg2, pandas, numpy, tqdm Python libraries

# Usage
1 #Set up PostgreSQL Database
  Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database instance running.
  Modify the db_credentials dictionary in the script to include your database credentials (username, password, host, port, and database name).
  
2 #Prepare Your CSV File

  Provide the path to your CSV file in the Path variable.
  Make sure the CSV file contains data that aligns with the intended table structure.
  
3 #Run the Script

  Execute the script after setting the CSV file path and database credentials.
  Adjust the table_name parameter in the import_csv_to_postgres function call to specify the desired table name for your data.
  
# Function Explanation
  import_csv_to_postgres(csv_file, table_name, db_credentials): Main function responsible for importing CSV data to the specified PostgreSQL database.
  map_data_type(dtype): Maps Python data types to PostgreSQL data types for table creation.
  convert_value(value): Handles conversion of specific data types (e.g., numpy int64) for compatibility with PostgreSQL.
  
# Notes
  Ensure psycopg2 and other required libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the script.
  This script assumes a direct mapping of CSV column types to PostgreSQL types. Adjust the map_data_type function as needed for specific data types.
  
# Disclaimer
  Use this script responsibly and ensure proper validation of data types and content before importing large datasets into your database.
